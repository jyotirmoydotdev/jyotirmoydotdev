# How to Change the Default Permission String for the Location-Access Alert in Expo

When you build an <Linkwithlogo text='Expo' url='https://expo.dev' icon={'https://img.icons8.com/?size=100&id=IpN1evivrDWO&format=png&color=ffffff'}/> app that requests location access, <Linkwithlogo text='iOS' url='http://appstoreconnect.apple.com/' icon={{icon:FaApple}}/> by default shows:

> “Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location.”

This vague prompt can trigger App Store rejections if you haven't clearly explained why you need location data. Apple's human-interface guidelines require you to supply a custom purpose string in your Info.plist so users understand what you,re doing with their location.

Below is the end-to-end solution I used—no more default Expo messaging.

## The Problem

- **Expo Go** and the old `expo build:ios` both use an un-modifiable, shared binary.
- Even if you set `ios.infoPlist` in **app.json**, your custom `NS…UsageDescription` keys are ignored.
- Running `npx expo run:ios` also compiles against Expo Go's binary, so native Info.plist edits never apply.

### Required Info.plist Keys

| Key                                                | Purpose                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`              | Why you need location **while** the app is in use.                                               |
| `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription`     | Why you need location **both** in foreground **and** background (iOS 11+).                       |
| `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription`                 | (Legacy) Why you need location always; still include for pre-iOS 11 or extra clarity.            |

## The Fix: Clean Prebuild + EAS Build

1. **Delete any stale native folders**  
   ```bash
   rm -rf ios
   ```

2. **Verify your `app.json`**
   Make sure you have **all three** keys under `expo.ios.infoPlist`:

   ```jsonc
   {
     "expo": {
       "ios": {
         "infoPlist": {
           "NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription":          "We need your location to show nearby restaurants.",
           "NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription": "We also use it in the background to track live deliveries.",
           "NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription":             "We use location at all times to keep your delivery status up‑to‑date."
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Prebuild a fresh native project**
   This regenerates `ios/` from your current app.json, including your custom Info.plist keys:

   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild --platform ios --clean
   ```
4. **Inspect in Xcode (optional but recommended)**

   * Open the generated workspace:

     ```bash
     open ios/YourApp.xcworkspace
     ```
   * In the project navigator, select **YourApp → Info.plist**.
   * Confirm all three keys appear with your custom strings.

5. **Build with EAS**

   ```bash
   eas build --platform ios
   ```

6. **Submit & Test**

   ```bash
   eas submit --platform ios --latest
   ```

   * This will automatically pick up your most recent EAS build and upload the `.ipa` to App Store Connect.
   * In App Store Connect, assign it to a TestFlight group and invite your testers.
   * On your TestFlight build, open the app and trigger a location permission request.

## Why This Works

* **`--clean`** wipes any cached native project so old Info.plist files don,t linger.
* **Expo Prebuild** reads your `app.json` and writes those keys into the real `Info.plist`.
* **EAS Build** produces a custom binary (unlike Expo Go), so iOS displays your exact strings.

With these steps, you'll comply with Apple's guidelines and avoid those frustrating App Store rejections.
