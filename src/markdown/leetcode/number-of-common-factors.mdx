Given two positive integers `a` and `b`, return *the number of **common** factors of `a` and `b`*.

An integer `x` is a **common factor** of `a` and `b` if `x` divides both `a` and `b`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= a, b <= 1000`

## Approach: Brute Force Iteration

```go
func commonFactors(a int, b int) int {
    counter := 0
    m := a
    if b < a {
        m = b
    }
    for i := 1; i <= m; i++ {
        if a % i == 0 && b % i == 0 {
            counter++
        }
    }
    return counter
}
```

### Intuition

We need to count all the numbers that divide both `a` and `b`. Since a factor of both cannot exceed the smaller number, we iterate from `1` to `min(a, b)` and check if each number is a factor of both.

### Algorithm

1. **Determine the Range:**  
   Compute `m = min(a, b)` as the upper bound for possible common factors.
2. **Iterate and Check:**  
   Loop from `i = 1` to `m`. For each `i`, check:
   - If `i` divides `a` (`a % i == 0`) **and**
   - If `i` divides `b` (`b % i == 0`).
3. **Count Common Factors:**  
   Increment a counter for each `i` that satisfies both conditions.
4. **Return the Count:**  
   After the loop, return the counter which holds the number of common factors.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
    `O(min(a, b))`  
    The loop runs from 1 to the smaller of the two numbers, making the time complexity proportional to `min(a, b)`.

- **Space Complexity:**  
    `O(1)`  
    Only a few extra variables are used (for the counter and the range limit), so the space complexity is constant.
