You are given an `m x n 2D` array `grid` of **positive** integers.

Your task is to traverse `grid` in a **zigzag** pattern while skipping every **alternate** cell.

Zigzag pattern traversal is defined as following the below actions:

- Start at the top-left cell `(0, 0)`.
- Move *right* within a row until the end of the row is reached.
- Drop down to the next row, then traverse left until the beginning of the row is reached.
- Continue **alternating** between right and left traversal until every row has been traversed.

**Note** that you **must skip** every alternate cell during the traversal.

Return an array of integers `result` containing, **in order**, the value of the cells visited during the zigzag traversal with skips

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n == grid.length <= 50`
- `2 <= m == grid[i].length <= 50`
- `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 2500`

## Approach: Traversal With Skip

```go
func zigzagTraversal(grid [][]int) []int {
	ans := []int{}
	for i, nums := range grid {
		if (i % 2) == 0 {
			for j, num := range nums {
				if ((i + j) % 2) == 0 {
					ans = append(ans, num)
				}
            }
		} else {
            for j := len(nums) - 1; j >= 0; j-- {
				if ((i + j) % 2) == 0 {
					ans = append(ans, nums[j])
				}
			}
        }
	}
	return ans
}
```

### Intuition
The idea is to traverse the grid row by row in a zigzag manner. For even-indexed rows, we move left-to-right; for odd-indexed rows, we traverse right-to-left. Additionally, we only collect numbers from positions where the sum of the row and column indices is even.

### Algorithm
1. **Traverse Rows:** Loop over each row in the grid using its index `i`.
2. **Determine Traversal Order:**
   - If `i` is even, iterate through the row from the beginning (left-to-right).
   - If `i` is odd, iterate in reverse (right-to-left).
3. **Skip Based on Condition:** For each element, check if `(i + j) % 2 == 0` (where `j` is the column index). Only if the condition holds, append the element to the answer list.
4. **Return Result:** After processing all rows, return the list of collected elements.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  `O(n * m)`  
  Each element in the grid (with `n` rows and `m` columns) is processed exactly once.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  `O(n * m)` (in the worst-case scenario)  
  The output list may store almost all the elements of the grid if the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0` holds for many elements.  
  Apart from the output, the extra space usage is constant.
