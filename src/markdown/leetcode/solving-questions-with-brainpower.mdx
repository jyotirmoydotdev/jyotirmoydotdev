You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `questions` where `questions[i] = [pointsᵢ, brainpowerᵢ]`.

The array describes the questions of an exam, where you have to process the questions **in order** (i.e., starting from question `0`) and make a decision whether to **solve** or **skip** each question. Solving question `i` will **earn** you `pointsᵢ` points but you will be **unable** to solve each of the next `brainpowerᵢ` questions. If you skip question `i`, you get to make the decision on the next question.

- For example, given `questions = [[3, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4], [2, 5]]`:
    - If question `0` is solved, you will earn `3` points but you will be unable to solve questions `1` and `2`.
    - If instead, question `0` is skipped and question `1` is solved, you will earn `4` points but you will be unable to solve questions `2` and `3`.
    
Return *the **maximum** points you can earn for the exam*.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= questions.length <= 10⁵`
- `questions[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= pointsᵢ, brainpowerᵢ <= 10⁵`

## Approach: Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up)

```go
func mostPoints(questions [][]int) int64 {
    n := len(questions)
    dp := make([]int64, n+1)
    for i := n - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
        next := min(i + questions[i][1] + 1, n)
        take := int64(questions[i][0]) + dp[next]
        dp[i] = max(dp[i+1], take)
    }
    return dp[0]
}
```

### Intuition
The key idea is to use dynamic programming by iterating backwards through the list of questions. For each question, you decide whether to:
- **Solve** it: Earn the current points and skip the next `brainpower` questions.
- **Skip** it: Consider the maximum points starting from the next question.

This way, each state `dp[i]` holds the maximum points you can earn starting at question `i`.

### Algorithm
1. **Initialization:**  
   Create a DP array `dp` of size `n+1` (where `n` is the number of questions). Initialize `dp[n]` to `0` since there are no questions after the last one.
2. **Reverse Iteration:**  
   Loop backwards from the last question to the first.
3. **Decision Making:**  
   For each question at index `i`:
   - **Solve:** Calculate `take = points[i] + dp[i + brainpower[i] + 1]`.  
     (Use `min` to ensure you don't go out of bounds.)
   - **Skip:** Use `dp[i+1]` which represents not solving the current question.
   - **Update:** Set `dp[i]` to the maximum of these two choices.
4. **Result:**  
   After processing all questions, `dp[0]` contains the maximum points achievable starting from the first question.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  `O(n)` – We iterate over each question once in reverse order.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  `O(n)` – We use a DP array of size `n+1` to store the computed results.
