You are given an integer `n`, the number of teams in a tournament that has strange rules:

- If the current number of teams is **even**, each team gets paired with another team. A total of `n / 2` matches are played, and `n / 2` teams advance to the next round.
- If the current number of teams is **odd**, one team randomly advances in the tournament, and the rest gets paired. A total of `(n - 1) / 2` matches are played, and `(n - 1) / 2 + 1` teams advance to the next round.

Return *the number of matches played in the tournament until a winner is decided.*

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 200`

## Approach: Simulation

```go
func numberOfMatches(n int) int {
	ans := 0
	for n > 1 {
		ans += n / 2
		if n%2 == 0 {
			n = n / 2
		} else {
			n = n/2 + 1
		}
	}
	return ans
}
```

### Intuition

The problem simulates a knockout tournament where, in each round, teams are paired to play matches. Every match eliminates one team. If there's an odd number of teams, one team gets a bye (automatically advances). This process continues until only one team remains.

### Algorithm

1. **Initialize**:  
   Set a counter `ans` to track the total number of matches played.

2. **Iterate Through Rounds**:  
   - While more than one team remains (`n > 1`):
     - Calculate the number of matches in the current round as `n / 2` and add it to `ans`.
     - Update the number of teams for the next round:
       - If `n` is even, all teams are paired, so next round has `n / 2` teams.
       - If `n` is odd, one team gets a bye, so next round has `n / 2 + 1` teams.

3. **Return the Result**:  
   Once the loop finishes, `ans` contains the total number of matches played.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  `O(log n)`  
  Each round roughly halves the number of teams, leading to a logarithmic number of iterations.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  `O(1)`  
  The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space.
